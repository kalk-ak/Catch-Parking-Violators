# Parking Violation Detector 🚗🚙

This project is a Python script I designed for Kellog Square Parking Ramp in Minneapolis to catch parking violations in cases where users register multiple vehicles under the same account and parked more than 1 car at the same time.

### 🛑 The Problem

In the original system, each car was tracked individually. That meant if a user had two cars parked at the same time, the system didn’t notice anything unusual. This allowed people to share cars with friends or family and avoid extra parking charges.

### ✅ The Solution

This script analyzes past parking transactions and flags situations where:

A single user has multiple registered vehicles.

Two or more of those vehicles were parked during overlapping times.

By identifying these overlaps, the script helps uncover violations that the old system would have missed.

### 🔍 Use Cases

Reviewing historical parking data to detect abuse.

Improving existing parking management systems.

Building a foundation for real-time violation detection.

The Original Scirpt I made was slow and inefficent with multiple nested for-loops. When editing and rewriting the script I made sure that it was faster and as efficient as possible.

NOTE: Documentation of the code was done through Gemini PRO and it is proof read.
